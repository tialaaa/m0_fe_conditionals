# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
    I feel very comfortable with the comparison operators that we learned in today's lesson; less so with the remainder operator that I learned to use for this project's Mild challenge.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
    Feeling confident. I'm used to working with conditionals in Excel, so a lot of these concepts transfer over, although they use slightly different syntax in Javascript.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
    Feeling confident, same reason.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
    I spent way too much time on this because of the remainder operator % challenge. I estimated 1 hour in total, then increased to 1.5 hours, and actually spent over 2 hours by the end.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    I need more practice with the conditional syntax. I sometimes forget where to use brackets or which type of brackets to use, and I'd like to eventually rely on my notes less for that. Hoping the Arrays and For Statement projects help solidify this more.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    Definitely going to research the remainder operator more to feel more comfortable with that. I couldn't explain it's use to someone else right now which tells me I don't fully know it.
